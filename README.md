# Chinese Calligraphy Style Recognition System

This repository contains the code and resources for the Chinese Calligraphy Style Recognition System.

## Saved Models

Due to GitHub's file size limits, I was unable to upload the Saved model (best_model.keras) that was trained on the large dataset. Instead, I have uploaded the Saved model (best_model.keras) that was trained on the small dataset.

If you are interested in training the model using the large dataset, you can find the data in the `large_data` folder. Note that training on the large dataset takes approximately 48 hours on an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.

## How to Use

To run the project:
- Clone this repository and use the provided model or train your own using the provided code and data.

### Training on Large Dataset
- If you'd like to train the model on the large dataset, you'll need access to a powerful GPU. Based on my experience using an Nvidia RTX 3090, training with the large data takes about 48 hours.
